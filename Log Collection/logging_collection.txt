Instrument app using soot and install it on your HMD.

Run the command from your terminal once:

adb logcat -G 256M

Then run the following, this will make sure to redirect OpenXR logs to logcat, and save the log file on your meta quest device:

adb logcat -f /sdcard/log_output.txt > /dev/null 2>&1 &

log_output.txt will contain: logical, app, opener and instrumented logs (if any)

Run perfetto script from the perfecto script folder, it saves output to the HMD device too.

To stop the logging:

Run adb shell to get access to the device's shell

ps -A | grep logd

To stop the logcat process, use the kill command followed by the PID you noted in the previous step:

kill <PID>

This will stop logcat and perfetto logging on your HMD device.

Retrieve the log file from the HMD device:

adb pull /sdcard/log_output.txt 
adb pull /data/misc/perfetto-traces/trace
